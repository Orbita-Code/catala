**Created:** 2026-02-08
**Author:** Jovana (manually reviewed all illustrations)
**Area:** illustrations
**Priority:** HIGH

## GLOBAL RULE (VERY IMPORTANT)
- All regenerated images must replace old ones everywhere (all tasks, games, exercises)
- Deleted images must not be referenced anywhere
- No English text on illustrations unless explicitly required
- All illustrations: 3D cartoon style, white background with decorative hearts and stars, 512x512px, for children ages 5-8

## REGENERATE (blurry, incorrect, or needs improvement)

### Priority: Wrong content (not what it should be)
- [ ] **entrada** — Current image is star mascot (WRONG). Must be a proper school/house entrance
- [ ] **fasada (facade)** — Current image is star mascot (WRONG). Delete old and generate a real building facade
- [ ] **peu** — Current image is star mascot (WRONG). Must be a foot (stopalo)
- [ ] **banyador-de-dona** — Current image is a stork (WRONG). Must be a female swimsuit
- [ ] **albert-dibuix-3 (pare)** — Must look like an adult father, NOT a child
- [ ] **albert-dibuix-4 (mare)** — Must look like an adult mother, NOT a child
- [ ] **muntanya** — No face, no eyes, no mouth. Must be a normal mountain
- [ ] **camaleó (camaleo)** — Regenerate
- [ ] **berenar** — Regenerate. Suggested: sandwich + apple + chocolate milk, possibly in a children's lunchbox
- [ ] **casa** — Regenerate; poorly done
- [ ] **paella** — Must clearly be a paella pan with rice, not just a random plate
- [ ] **sotaterra** — Current shows metro entrance with text "metro". Delete existing, verify meaning, regenerate correctly

### Priority: Blurry images
- [ ] **ajuntament** — Blurry. Text on image must clearly say AJUNTAMENT (Catalan only)
- [ ] **armari** — Blurry
- [ ] **barca** — Blurry
- [ ] **bicicleta** — Blurry
- [ ] **bomber** — Blurry
- [ ] **carrer** — Blurry
- [ ] **carter** — Blurry; postman, must be adult
- [ ] **coixí** — Blurry
- [ ] **cotxe** — Blurry
- [ ] **cuiner** — Blurry
- [ ] **esmorzar** — Blurry. Suggested: breakfast with sun, cereal, orange juice, croissant
- [ ] **fanall** — Street lantern, regenerate
- [ ] **far** — Car headlight, regenerate
- [ ] **farmacèutic (farmaceutic)** — Blurry

- [ ] **cansalada** — Regenerate
- [ ] **cambrer** — Regenerate

### Priority: Content corrections needed
- [ ] **bebè** — Current baby illustration is not good, regenerate
- [ ] **cotó** — Remove mint leaf. Show cotton pads, cotton wool, possibly cotton branch
- [ ] **crema** — No English text ("cream" forbidden). If face cream -> cosmetic jar; if tube -> Catalan text only. Must not look like food or toothpaste
- [ ] **socorrista** — Lifeguard. No English text ("lifeguard" forbidden)
- [ ] **venda** — Bandaged arm + bandage roll + scissors. No mint leaf
- [ ] **xarop** — Cough syrup. No English text allowed
- [ ] **vies** — Duplicate existed; one deleted. Regenerate remaining correctly

## NEW ILLUSTRATIONS (generate from scratch)
- [ ] **aigualera** — Sink; same object as aiguera, but generate as separate image
- [ ] **aiguera** — Sink; same object as aigualera, but generate as separate image

## REGENERATE WITH TASK LOGIC CHANGES
- [ ] **arbre-familiar-complet** — Regenerate completely. Remove English text, remove random names. Must be a clean family tree like in workbook. Replace parents with newly generated pare and mare images
- [ ] **casa-exterior** — Image concept is good (garage, garden, shutters, balcony, roof, chimney, antenna) BUT: no labels on image. All labels must be in code as fields/arrows for children to fill in
- [ ] **aliments** — Verify task logic. Image currently contains names of products; likely should have no text, only empty fields for children to write names
- [ ] **animals** — Same as aliments. No animal names written on image; children should write them in fields
- [ ] **roba-silueta** — NOT OK. Text labels point to wrong items. Verify task purpose. Either correct arrows or regenerate without text

## VERIFY (check before deciding)
- [ ] **globus** — Currently looks like a hot air balloon. Confirm whether balloon or globe is intended, then regenerate
- [ ] **golfes** — Currently shows attic; this was already àtic. Clarify usage and regenerate or remove duplicate
- [ ] **llop** — Means wolf (vuk). Verify current image; if unclear, regenerate as a clear wolf
- [ ] **prestatge** — Shelf; verify if needed
- [ ] **prestatgeria** — Shelving unit; verify if this and prestatge are truly different. Merge/remove if necessary

## DELETE (wrong/duplicate)
- [ ] **musclo** — DELETE. We already have musclos, which is much better
- [ ] **panxa 2** — DELETE. Bear pointing to belly is incorrect. Keep panxa (woman with belly)

## KEEP AS IS
- **panxa** — Keep existing image (woman with belly)
